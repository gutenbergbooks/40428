<h4>WE OUGHT TO OBEY GOD RATHER THAN MAN.</h4>


<p>Man was made for something higher and better,
than either to make, or to obey, merely human
laws. He is the creature of God, is subject to his
laws, and can find his perfection, and consequent
happiness, only in obeying those laws. As his
moral perfection, the life of his life, is involved in
this obedience, it is impossible that any power
should lay him under obligation to disobey. The
known will of God, if not the foundation of right,
is its paramount rule, and it is because human
governments are ordained by him, that we owe
them obedience. We are bound to them, not by
compact, but only as God's institutions for the
good of the race. This is what the Bible, though
sometimes referred to as supporting arbitrary power,
really teaches. It does not support arbitrary
power. Rightly understood, it is a perfect rule of
duty, and as in every thing else, so in the relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of subjects and rulers. It lays down the true
principles, it gives us the guiding light. When
the general question is whether human governments
are to be obeyed, the answer is, "He that
resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of
God." "The powers that be are ordained of
God." But when these powers overstep their
appointed limits, and would lord it over the conscience,
and come between man and his maker,
then do we hear it uttered in the very face of
power, and by the voice of inspiration, no less
than of indignant humanity, "We ought to obey
God rather than men."</p>

<p>It has been in connexion with the maintenance
of this principle, first proclaimed by an Apostle
of Christ eighteen hundred years ago, that all
the civil liberty now in the world has sprung up.
It is to the fearless assertion of this principle by
our forefathers, that we owe it that the representatives
of a free people are assembled here this
day to worship God according to the dictates of
their own consciences, to seek to Him for wisdom
in their deliberations, and to acknowledge the
subordination of all human governments to that
which is divine.</p>

<p>Permit me then, as appropriate to the present
occasion, to call the attention of this audience,</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
1st. To the grounds on which all men are bound
to adhere to the principle stated in the text; and</p>

<p>2d. To the consequences of such adherence,
on the part, both of subjects, and of rulers.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I observe, then, that we ought to obey God
rather than men, because human governments are
comparatively so limited and negative in their
bearing upon the great purposes, first, of individual,
and second, of social existence.</p>

<p>The purposes for which man was made, must
evidently involve in their accomplishment, both
his duty and his happiness; and nothing can be
his duty which would contravene those purposes.
Among them, as already intimated, the highest
is the moral perfection of the individual; for as
it is by his moral nature that man is distinguished
from the inferior animals, so it is only in the perfection
of that nature, that his perfection, as man,
can consist. As absolute perfection can belong
only to God, that of man must be relative, that is,
it must consist in the proper adjustment of relations,
and especially in the relation of his voluntary
actions to the end for which God designed
him. This is our idea of perfection, when we
affirm it of the works of man. It involves, mainly,
such a relation of parts as is necessary to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
perfect accomplishment of the end in view. A
watch is perfect when it is so constructed that its
motions exactly correspond in their little revolutions
with those of the sun in the heavens; and
man is perfect when his will corresponds in its
little circle of movement with the will of God in
heaven. This correspondence, however, is not to
be produced by the laws of an unconscious mechanism,
but by a voluntary, a cheerful, a filial
co-operation. It is this power of controlling his
faculties with reference to an ultimate end, of accepting
or rejecting the purpose of his being,
as indicated by God in the very structure of his
powers, and proclaimed in his word, that contradistinguishes
man from every inferior being, and
gives scope for what is properly termed, character.
Inferior beings have qualities by which they are
distinguished, they have characteristics, but not
<i>character</i>, which always involves a moral element.
A brute does not govern its own instincts, it is
governed by them. A tree is the product of an
agency which is put forth through it, but of which
it is not conscious, and which it does not control.
But God gives man to himself, and then sets before
him, in the tendency of every thing that has unconscious
life towards its own perfection, the great
moral lesson that nature was intended to teach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
He then causes every blade of grass, and every
tree, to become a preacher and a model, calling
upon him to put forth his faculties, not without law,
but to accept the law of his being, and to work
out a character and a happiness in conformity with
that. It is, as I have said, the power which man
has to accept or reject this law of his being, the
great law of love, that renders him capable of
character, and it is evidently as a theatre, on
which this may be manifested, that the present
scene of things is sustained. Not with more certainty
do the processes of vegetation point to the
blossoms and the fruit as the results to which
they conspire, than does every thing in the nature
and condition of man indicate the formation of a
specific, voluntary, moral character, as the purpose
for which God placed him here. But this purpose
is not recognized at all by human governments,
and we have only to observe the limited and negative
agency which they incidentally bring to bear
upon it, to see how insignificant must be their
claims when they would come into conflict with
those of the government of God.</p>

<p>I observe then, first, that human governments
regard man solely as the member of a community;
whereas it is chiefly as an individual, that the
government of God regards him. Isolate a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
from society, take him beyond the reach of human
government, and his faculties are not changed.
He is still the creature of God, a dweller in his
universe, retaining every thing he ever possessed
that was noble in reason, or grand in destiny, and
in his solitude, where yet he would not be alone,
the government of God would follow him, and
would require of him such manifestations of goodness
as he might there exercise&mdash;the adoration
of his Creator, resignation to his will, and a temperate
and prudent use of the blessings within his
power. Indeed, so far as responsibility is concerned,
the divine government considers man,
whether in solitude or in a crowd, solely as an
individual, and produces an isolation of each as
complete as if he were the only person in the
universe. God knows nothing of divided responsibility,
and whether acting alone, or as a member
of a corporation or of a legislature, every man is
responsible to him for just what he does as a moral
being, and for nothing more. The responsibility
of each is kept disentangled from that of all others,
and lies as well defined in the eye of God, as if
that eye were fixed upon him alone. The kingdom
of God is within man, and there it is, in the
secret soul of each, that the contest between light
and darkness, between God and Satan is going on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and in the struggle, in the victory or the defeat,
he who walks the city is as much alone as the
hermit in his cell. It is over the thoughts of man,
his affections, his passions, his purposes, which
mock at human control, that the government of
God claims dominion; it is with reference to
these, and not to the artificial index of appearances
which we set to catch the eye of the world,
that the register of Heaven is kept. On the other
hand, how very few of the moral actions of man can
human government reach, how imperfectly can it
reach even these! It is only of overt acts, those
which it can define, and which can be proved
before a human tribunal, that it can take cognizance;
and its treatment even of these can never
be adjusted to the varying shades of guilt. It has
no eye to reach the springs of action. It may see
the movements of the machinery above, perplexed,
and apparently contradictory; but it cannot uncover
the great wheel, and look in upon the simple
principle which makes character, and sets the
whole in motion.</p>

<p>But I observe again, that human governments
are not only thus limited, but are also chiefly
negative in their influence upon the formation of
individual character. There is, indeed, a positive
and widely pervading moral influence connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
with the character, and station, and acts, of those
who are in authority. This cannot be too prominently
stated, the responsibility connected with
it cannot be too carefully regarded; still this
influence is entirely incidental, and is the same in
kind with that exerted by any distinguished private
individual. Human governments have also
positive power to furnish <i>facilities</i>, as distinguished
from <i>inducements</i>. They can authorise and guard
the issue of paper money, to give facilities to men
of business; they can lay down rail-roads, thus
opening facilities to the spirit of enterprise, and
calling out the neglected resources of the State;
they can too, and our fathers did it, construct and
keep in repair the <i>rail-roads of the mind</i>, thus
giving facilities to the poorest boy in the glens of
the mountains to come out and be an honor to
his country. Still, human government is chiefly a
system of restraint for the purpose of protection.
Its object is to give equal protection to all in using
their faculties as they please, provided they do
not interfere with the rights of others. It does
not propose to furnish inducements, but to enable
men to live quiet and peaceable lives, while they
act in view of the great inducements furnished by
the government of God.</p>

<p>In saying this, I do not undervalue the benefits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
conferred by human governments, but only assign
them their true place. The office performed by
them is indispensable. They are the enclosure of
the field, without which certainly nothing could
come to maturity; but they are not the soil and
the rain, and the sunshine, which cause vegetation
to spring up. These are furnished by the government
of God, which is not only a system of restraint
and protection, but also, and chiefly, of inducements
to excellence. Into the ear of the
humblest of its subjects it whispers, as it points
upward, "Glory," "Honor," "Immortality,"
"Eternal Life." It is parental in its character,
makes us members of a family, gives us objects of
affection, and by its perfect standard of moral excellence,
and the character of God which it sets
before us, it purifies and elevates the mind. Without
a God to whom he is related and accountable,
man has neither dignity nor hope. Without God,
the universe has no cause, its contrivances indicate
no intelligence, its providence no goodness,
its related parts and processes no unity, its events
no convergence to one grand result, and the glorious
spectacle presented in the earth and the heavens,
instead of calling forth admiration and songs,
is an enigma perplexing to the intellect, and torturing
to the heart. Seen in its connexion with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
God, the universe of matter is as the evening
cloud that lies in the sunlight, radiant, and skirted
with glory; without him it is the same cloud cold
and dark when that sunlight is gone. Without
God, man is an orphan; he has no protector here,
and no Father's house in which he may hope for a
mansion hereafter. His life is at his own disposal,
and has no value except in relation to his personal
and present enjoyment.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as the idea of God is received,
and his relations to the universe are intimately
felt, unity and harmony are introduced into
our conceptions of that which is without, and acquiescence
and hope reign within. Nature, as
more significant, becomes more a companion. Her
quiet teachings and mute prophecies, her indexes
pointing to the spirit land, instead of being felt as
a mockery, are in accordance with the best hopes,
and the revealed destiny of man. Life, too, assumes
a new aspect. A common destiny is set
before all, and the consciousness of it runs as a
thread of sympathy through the race. The poor
man is elevated when he sees that the principle of
duty may be tried and strengthened in his humble
sphere, as well as in those that are higher, and his
labor becomes a cheerful service done with good
will from the heart. Every duty to man becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
doubly sacred as due also to God, and the humblest
life, pursued from a conscientious regard to
his will, is invested with an unspeakable dignity.
It is indeed, I may remark, this view of life that
furnishes the only possible ground of equality. Men
are upon an equality only as they are equally upon
trial in the sight of God, and nothing will ever reconcile
them to the unavoidable inequalities of the
present state, but the consciousness that their circumstances
were allotted to them by Him who best
knew what trials they would need, and whose
equal eye regards solely the degree in which their
moral nature is improved by the trial. When
this is felt, there is, under all circumstances, a
basis for dignity without pride, for activity without
restlessness, for diversity of condition without discord.</p>

<p>And not only the aspect of life in the relations
of men to each other, but its end also is changed.
The moral nature assumes its true position, and,
acting in the presence of a perfect law as its standard,
and of a perfect gospel as its ground of hope,
the idea of true liberty dawns upon the mind.
This consists in the coincidence of the affections
and inclinations with correct principle. It is only
when the internal constitution of a reasonable being
is in harmony with the law under which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
acts, that he is conscious of no restraint, and knows
what true freedom is. The chief value of what is
commonly called liberty, consists in the opportunity
it gives to use our faculties without molestation for
the attainment of this. This is that glorious liberty
of the sons of God, of which the Scriptures
speak. It is not a mere freedom from restraint
which may be abused for the purposes of wrong-doing;
and become a curse, merely making the difference
between a brute enclosed and a brute at
large; but it is, in its commencement, the resolute
adoption of the law of conscience and of God as the
rule of life; in its progress, a successful struggle
with whatever opposes this law; in its completion,
the harmonious and joyful action of every
power in its fulfilment. This is the only liberty
known under the government of God. He who
knows it not is the slave of sin. He who struggles
not for it, is in a contented bondage of which
physical slavery is but a feeble type. The perfection
of this liberty is only another name for
moral perfection, which, as I have said, is the great
end of the individual; and as the direct motives
and means for the attainment of this are furnished
only by the government of God, it is evident that
"We ought to obey God rather than men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Having thus spoken of the effect of human government
upon man in his individual character, I
now proceed to inquire, whether it is equally limited
and negative in its bearing upon him in his
social condition.</p>

<p>And here I remark, that it is only incidentally
that human government is necessary to man as a
social being at all. Society was before government,
and if man had retained his original state, it
might, perhaps, have existed without it till the
end of time. Man is constituted by his Creator a
social being; he has faculties to the expansion
and perfection of which society is requisite, but
he has no faculties the necessities of which constitute
him a political being. There must be politicians,
just as there must be farmers, and merchants,
and physicians, that they and others may
enjoy social life; but social life is corrupted when
politics enter largely into it. It is not sufficiently
noticed, that it is through social institutions and
habits far more than through political forms, that
the happiness or misery of man is produced. It
was not from the oppressions of the government,
but from a corrupted social state, that the prophet
of old wished to flee into the wilderness. It was
because his people were all adulterers, an assembly
of treacherous men, because every brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
would supplant, and every neighbor would walk
with slanders. Such a state of things may exist
under any form of political organization. It may
exist under ours. Men may be loud in their praise
of republican forms, and yet be false, and unkind,
and litigious; they may be indolent, and profane,
and sabbath breakers, and gamblers, and licentious,
and intemperate. Yes, and there may be
neighborhoods of such men, and the place where
they assemble nightly, hard by a banner that creaks
in the wind, may be the liveliest image of hell
that this earth can present. I certainly know, and
my hearers are fortunate if they do not know,
neighborhoods in this land of liberty and equality,
where the only use made of liberty is to render
families and society wretched, and where the only
equality, is an equality in vice and social degradation,
which no man is permitted even to attempt
to rise above without constant annoyance. Better,
far better, is family affection, and kind neighborhood
under a regal, or even a despotic government,
than such liberty as this.</p>

<p>Government then is not an end, but a means.
Society is the end, and government should be the
agent of society, to benefit man in his social condition.
The extent to which it can do this will
depend on its form, and the power with which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
is entrusted. Absolute power, which should be
used for this purpose, is generally abused. Considering
itself as having interests distinct from
those of the people, it too often seeks to keep
them in a state of degradation, and to appropriate
to itself the largest possible share of those blessings
which ought to be equally diffused. "Get
out of my sunlight," said Diogenes to Alexander
the Great: "Get out of my sunlight"&mdash;cease to
obstruct the free circulation of blessings intended
for all, might the people say under any arbitrary
form of government ever yet administered. Still,
such a government, when under the direction of
wisdom and benevolence, has power to produce
great social and moral revolutions for the good of
mankind. Such a revolution was commenced by
Peter the Great, and his measures, though necessary,
were such as none but an absolute monarch
could have adopted. Aside from christianity, the
judicious exercise of such a power is the only hope
of a people debased beyond a certain point. The
King of Prussia can maintain a better and more
efficient system of schools, than any republican
government. He can provide qualified teachers,
and can compel the children to attend.</p>

<p>But when, as in this country, government is the
direct agent of society, when it is so far controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
by the people as to secure the majority at least
from oppression, being merely an expression of
the will of that majority, it can have no power to
produce moral and social reformations. Laws do
not execute themselves, and in such a state of
things they cannot be effectually executed if the
violation of them is upheld by public sentiment.
In such a case, when vices begin to creep in, and
the tendency of things is downwards, we must
have a force different from that of the government;
we must have <i>moral</i> power. Here religion
comes in, and must come in, or "the beginning
of the end" has come. The intellect must
be enlightened, and the conscience quickened, and
moral life infused into the mass; the good and the
evil must commingle in free conflict, and public
sentiment must be changed. When this is done,
when patriotism, and philanthropy, and religion,
have caused an ebb-tide in the flood of evil that
was coming up over the land, then government
may come in, not to carry forward a moral reformation
by force, but to erect a barrier against the
return of that tide. It can secure what these
agents have gained. It can put a shield into the
hands of society, with which it can, if it pleases,
protect itself against that selfishness and malignity
which always lurk in its borders, and which moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
influence cannot reach. If, for example, polygamy
were established among us as it is among the
Turks, a government like ours could do nothing
for its removal. But religion could awaken a
sense of obligation, and statistics could point out
the number of poor women and uneducated children
thrown by it for support mainly upon those
who had pledged themselves to be the husband of
one wife, and christian and philanthropic effort
might show that it was injurious to individuals, and
families, and the state; and then a law might be
passed, as there has been, to defend society against
this evil.</p>

<p>This inefficacy of our government to produce
moral and social reformations should be well
understood, because it throws the fearful responsibility
of maintaining our institutions directly upon
the people, where it must rest. A government
originating in society, can have but slight ground
to stand on in resisting its downward tendency.
That there is in society such a tendency, all history
shows. As nations have become older, they
have invariably become more corrupt. They have
never reached that point in general morality at
which men cease to corrupt each other by associating
together. Such a tendency, not counteracted,
must be fatal to republican governments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
for republican government is self-government,
and as the internal law becomes feeble, external
force must be increased; and accordingly we find
that every people hitherto, have either been under
regal power from the beginning, or have, in time,
reached a point in corruption, when that power
became necessary. Republican government then,
is not so much the cause of a good social state, as
its sign. It can never be borne up, with its stars
and stripes floating, upon the surface of a society
that is not strongly impregnated with virtue.
Take this away, and it goes down by its own
weight, and the beast of tyranny, with its seven
heads and ten horns, comes up out of the troubled
waters. Here is the turning point with us. All
depends upon the influences that go to form the
character of our people. Those who control these
influences will really govern the country. To this
point we turn our eyes anxiously. At this point
we look to legislators to stand in their lot, and do
what is appropriate to their station. At this point
we look especially to fathers and mothers, the
guardians of domestic virtue.&mdash;Those waters will
be sweet that are fed by sweet springs. We look
to christian ministers, to enlightened teachers, to
patriotic authors and editors, to every good citizen.
If there ever was a country in which all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
were called upon to do their utmost, this is that
country; if there ever was a government that
was called upon to second in every proper way
the efforts of these, this is that government. To
all these we look; but our trust is only in the influences
they may bring to bear from the blessed
gospel of Christ, from the government of God.
"We ought to obey God rather than men."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>I have thus shown, as fully as the time would
permit, though far too briefly to do justice to the
subject, the grounds on which we ought to obey
God rather than men. These are to be found in
the relation of the divine, and of human government
respectively, to the ends of individual, and
of social existence. But the occasion on which
the text was uttered, a subject having directly refused
obedience to rulers lawfully constituted, will
lead us to consider the effects of the principle of
the text when acted upon by men in those relations
in which civil liberty is directly involved&mdash;in
the relations of subjects and of rulers. What
then will be the effect of an adherence to this
principle on the part of subjects, as such?</p>

<p>There is a tendency in irresponsible power to
accumulate. It first gains control over property,
and life, and every thing from which a motive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
resistance based on the interests of the present
life, could be drawn. But it is not satisfied with
this. Nothing avails it so long as there is a Mordecai
sitting at the King's gate that does not rise
up and do it reverence. It must also control the
conscience, and make the religious nature subservient
to its purposes. Accordingly, the grand device
of the enemies of civil liberty, has been so to
incorporate religion with the government, that all
those deep and ineradicable feelings which are
associated with the one, should also be associated
with the other, and that he who opposed the government
should not only bring upon himself the
arm of the civil power, but also the fury of religious
zeal. The most melancholy and heart-sickening
chapter in the history of man, is that in
which are recorded the enormities committed by a
lust of power, and by malignity, in alliance with a
perverted religious sentiment. The light that was
in men has become darkness, and that darkness
has been great. The very instrument appointed
by God for the deliverance and elevation of man,
has been made to assist in his thraldom and degradation.
When christianity appeared, the alliance
of religion with oppressive power was universal.
In such a state of things, there seemed no hope
for civil liberty but in bringing the conscience out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
from this unholy alliance, and putting it in a position
in which it must show its energies in opposition
to power. This christianity did. It brought
the conscience to a point where it not only might
resist human governments, but where, as they
were then exercised, it was compelled to resist
them. This appeared when the text was uttered,
and there was then a rock raised in the ocean of
tyranny which has not been overflowed to this day.
The same qualities which make the conscience so
potent an ally of power, must, when it is enlightened
by a true knowledge of God and of duty,
and when immortality is clearly set before the
mind, make it the most formidable of all barriers
to tyranny and oppression.</p>

<p>By thus bringing the moral nature of man to act
in opposition to power, and by giving him light,
and strength, and foothold, to enable him to sustain
that opposition, christianity has done an inestimable
service, and has placed humanity at the only
point where its highest grandeur appears. At
this point, sustained by principle, and often in
the person of the humblest individual, it bids defiance
to all the malice of men to wrest from it its
true liberty. It bids tyranny do its worst, and
though its ashes may be scattered to the winds, it
leaves its startling testimony, and the inspiration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
its great example to coming times. The power
to do this, christianity alone can give. No other
religion has ever so demonstrated its evidences to
the senses, and caused its adaptations to the innermost
wants of the soul to be felt, as to enable man
to stand alone against the influence of whatever was
dear in affection, and flattering in promises, and
fearful in torture. Other religions have had their
<i>victims</i>, who have been led, amidst the plaudits of
surrounding multitudes, to throw themselves under
the wheels of a system already established; but
not their <i>martyrs</i>, who, when duty has permitted it,
have fled to the fastnesses of the mountains; and
when it has not, have stood upon their rights, and
contested every inch of ground, and met death
soberly and firmly, only when it was necessary.
When this has been done by multitudes it has
caused power to respect the individual, to respect
humanity; and while christianity was wading
through the blood of ten persecutions, it was fighting
more effectually than had ever been done before,
the battles of civil liberty. The call to obey
God rather than men met with a response, and it
is upon this ground that the battle has been opened
in every case in which civil liberty now exists.
It is upon this ground alone that it can be maintained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>I deem it of great importance that this point
should be fully and often presented, because it is
vital, and because there are constant attempts made
to obscure it. Whatever elevates the individual,
whatever gives him worth in his own estimation
and that of others, whatever invests him with
moral dignity, must be favorable both to pure morality
and to civil liberty. Hence it is that these
are both incidental results of christianity. They
are not the gifts which she came to bestow&mdash;these
are life and immortality. They are not the white
raiment in which her followers are to walk in the
upper temple; but they are the earthly garments
with which she would clothe the nations&mdash;they are
the brightness which she leaves in her train as she
moves on towards heaven, and calls on men to follow
her there. These belong to her alone. Infidels
may filch her morality, as they have often
done, and then boast of their discoveries. But in
their hands that morality is lopped off from the
body of faith on which it grew, and produces no
fruit. They may boast, as they do, of a liberty
which they never could have achieved. But under
its protection they advance doctrines and advocate
practices which would corrupt it into license.
Their only strength lies in endeavoring, in the sacred
name of liberty, to corrupt the virtuous, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
to excite the hatred of the vicious against those
restraints without which liberty cannot exist, and
society has no ground of security. "Promising liberty
to others, they are themselves the servants of
corruption." Liberty cannot exist without morality,
nor general morality without a pure religion.</p>

<p>The doctrine thus stated is fully confirmed by
history. The reformation by Luther was made on
strictly religious grounds. He found an opposition
between the decrees of the Pope and the commands
of God, and it was the simple purpose, resolutely
adhered to, to obey God rather than men,
that caused Europe to rock to its centre. In the
train of this religious reformation civil liberty followed,
but became settled and valuable only as
religious liberty was perfected. It was every
where on the ground of conscience towards God
that the first stand was taken, and in those countries
where the struggle for religious liberty commenced
but did not succeed, as in Spain and Italy,
civil liberty has found no resting place for the sole
of her foot to this day. It is conceded even by
Hume that England owes her civil liberty to the
Puritans, and the history of the settlement and
progress of this country as a splendid exemplification
of the principle in question, needs but to be
mentioned here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>In speaking thus of the resistance of christian
subjects to the government, perhaps I should guard
against being misunderstood. In no case can it be
a factious resistance. It cannot be stimulated by
any of the ordinary motives to such resistance&mdash;by
discontent, or passion, or ambition, or a love of
gain. In no case can it show itself in the disorganizing,
the aggressive, and in a free government,
the suicidal spirit of mobs. Christians have in
their eye a grand and a holy object, and all they
wish is to go forward, without violating the rights
of others, to its attainment. In so doing they set
themselves in opposition to nobody, but merely
exercise an inalienable right, and if others oppose
them, they must still go forward and obey God,
be the consequences what they may.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We will now consider, as was proposed, the
effect of an adherence to the principle of the text
on the part of rulers. This becomes appropriate
from the peculiar form of our government, and
the relation which the rulers hold to the people.
Rulers have indeed, in all countries, need to be
exhorted to obey God, but when their will is supreme,
and their power is independent of the people,
there can be no propriety in exhorting them
to obey God rather than men. In this country,
however, this principle needs to be enforced upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
legislators and rulers quite as much as upon the
people, perhaps even more. It is at this point, if
I mistake not, that we are to look for the danger
peculiar to our institutions through those in authority.
In other countries the danger is from the
accumulation and tyrannical use of power. With
us, limited as is the tenure of office, there is little
danger of direct oppression. The danger is that
those who are in office, and those who wish for it,
will, for the sake of immediate popularity, lend the
sanction of their names to doctrines and practices,
which, if carried into effect, must destroy all government.
How is it else that mobs should often
escape with so little rebuke? How is it else that
we hear such extravagant and disorganizing doctrines
maintained in regard to the rights of a
majority respecting property, and their power to
set aside any guaranties of former Legislatures?
Certainly the people are the fountain of power.
They establish the government, they have a right
to alter it; but when it is established, the state
becomes personified through it, and its acts are to
be consistent. When it is established, it <i>is</i> a government,
it has authority, it becomes God's institution,
and those who administer it are to obey
God rather than men. Wo to this country, when
the people shall become to those in place, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
object of adulation and of an affected idolatry.
Wo to this country, when the people shall cease to
reverence the government as the institution of God
because it is established through them; when they
shall suppose that it is in such a sense theirs, that
they can supersede its acts in any way except by
constitutional forms.</p>

<p>There is also another reason why the principle
of the text ought to be especially regarded by the
rulers of this country. So far as a nation can be
considered and treated as a moral person, its character
must be indicated by the acts of its rulers.
Accordingly, we find that under every form of
government, God has made nations responsible, as
in the natural course of things they evidently
must be, for what is done by their rulers. But if
this is so in monarchical governments, where the
agency of the people is so little connected with
public acts, much more must it be so in one like
ours. Here the rulers represent the people more
immediately. They indicate in the eyes of the
world, the moral condition of the people, and
hence the peculiar responsibility of those who act
under the oath of God in making and administering
the laws of a representative government. If it
can ever be required of God to vindicate his administration
by the treatment of any people, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
must be of one whose government is thus administered.</p>

<p>I observe then that the principle of the text
should be adopted by rulers, because it furnishes
the only broad and safe basis of political action.
The adoption of this principle I consider the first
requisite of a wise, in opposition to a cunning and
temporizing statesman. Statesmanship, as distinguished
from that skilful combination of measures
which has for its object personal advancement,
consists very much in a perception of the connexion
there is between the prosperity of states, and
the accordance of their laws and social institutions
with the laws of justice, and benevolence, and
temperance, which are the laws of God. The
laws of God are uniform. The general tendencies
which he has inwrought into the system
will take effect, and nothing, not shaped
in accordance with these can stand. Now it is
an attempt to evade the effect of these tendencies
by expedients in particular instances and
for the sake of particular ends, that has been
called statesmanship; while he only is the true
statesman who sees what these tendencies are,
and shapes his laws and institutions in accordance
with them. The mere politician, if I may so designate
him, perceives the movements which take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
place in the different parts of society relatively to
each other, and is complacently skilful in adjusting
them to his purposes, but he fails to see that
general movement by which the whole is drifted
on together, and which is bearing society to a
point where elements that he had not dreamed of
will be called into action, and where his petty
expedients will become in a moment, but as the
barriers of sand which the child raises upon the
beach, when the tide begins to rise.</p>

<p>"I tremble for my country," said an American
statesman, in a sentence, which, though awfully
ominous in the connexion in which it was uttered,
does equal honor to his head and his heart, "I
tremble for my country when I remember that
God is just." In that sentence are involved the
principles of that higher statesmanship before
which the expedients of merely expert men dwindle
into nothing. He knew not how, or where,
or when, the blow might fall; but he knew that
there was always a joint in the harness of injustice,
where the arrow of retribution, though it might
seem to be speeding at a venture, would surely find
its way. The higher movements of Divine Providence
include the lower. Sooner or later all particular,
and for a time apparently anomalous cases
are brought under its general rules, and he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
read the history of the past with little benefit,
who has failed to see how the giant machinery of
that Providence, in the intermediate spaces of
which there is ample room for the free play of
human agency, takes up the results of that agency
as they are wrought out, and applies them to the
execution of its own uniform laws, and the accomplishment
of its own predicted purposes. These
purposes, as declared by those divine records
whose prophecies have now become history, were
often such as no human sagacity, looking merely
at second causes, could have anticipated, such as
no human power then existing could have effected.
Still, they were wrought out in conformity with
that higher, and uniform, and all-encompassing
movement with reference to which he who stands
at the helm should guide the state, but to ascertain
which, he must not take his bearings from the
shifting headlands of circumstances, but must lift
his eye to those eternal principles which abide
ever the same. On this subject there is written
upon the walls of the past a lesson for statesmen
that needs no interpreter. Look at Babylon. Who
is it that stands before its walls, and utters its
doom? It is a despised Jew. And who is he
that walks in pride upon those walls, and as he
points to that mighty city as the centre of civilization<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and power, as combining every advantage of
climate and of commerce, mocks at that doom?
It is a politician of those days. The voice of the
prophet is uttered, and it seems to pass idly upon
the wind. The eye of sense sees no effect. No
clouds gather, no lightnings descend. But that
voice was not in vain. The waters of desolation
heard it in their distant caves, and never ceased
to rise till they had whelmed palace and tower
and temple in one undistinguished ruin. Even
now that voice abides there, and hangs as a spirit
of the air over that desolation, and the Arabian
hears it, warning him not to pitch his tent there,
and the wild beast of the desart and the owl and
the satyr hear it, and come up and dwell and
dance there. Look at Jerusalem. Who is he that
stands upon mount Olivet and weeps as he looks
upon the city, and assigns, as the cause of his
tears, that he would often have gathered her children
together as a hen gathereth her chickens
under her wings, but she would not? Ah! what
political Jew would have thought of <i>that</i>! He
would have turned his attention to the purposes
of governors and the intrigues of courts. Into
his estimate of the causes that might affect the
prosperity of Jerusalem, the moral temper of the
nation as indicated by its rejection of Jesus of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Nazareth, would not have entered. And yet, it
was from this rejection, even in the way of natural
consequence, from the want of those moral qualities
which only a regard to his teachings could
have produced among them, that the destruction
of the Jews resulted. Nothing else could have
destroyed their fool-hardy confidence in God, or
have allayed those fiendish passions which led
contending factions to fill the streets of the city
with dead bodies even in the midst of the siege.
But they would not have his spirit; they would
not have him to reign over them, and we know
that from the moment the words dropped from his
lips, "Your house is left unto you desolate," that
was a doomed city, and no political skill could
have deferred the horrors of a siege and of a final
overthrow, such as was not from the beginning of
the world, no, nor ever shall be. And not only
from Babylon and Jerusalem, but from the grave
of every nation buried in antiquity, from Nineveh,
and Tyre, and Edom, and Egypt, there comes a
voice calling upon rulers to be "just, ruling in
the fear of God." The true cause of their destruction
was the attitude which they assumed
towards the will, and worship, and people of God.</p>

<p>It is from these moral causes, between which
and the result there is no immediate, nor, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
superficial eye, perceptible connexion, that I fear
most for the stability of our institutions. It is
when the sun is shining most brightly, and the
face of the sky shows, it may be, not a single
cloud, that the elements of the tornado are ascending
most rapidly; and it is when men are in prosperity
and in fancied security that they become
presumptuous, and that a disastrous train of causes
is silently put in motion, as resistless as the tornado.
Upon this point of security, the eye of the
true statesman is fixed. It is here that he sees
the danger and provides against it; while the
mere politician knows nothing, and sees nothing,
till he begins, when it is too late, to see the lightnings,
and hear the thunders of embodied wrath.</p>

<p>Can, then, the rulers of this country, in disregard
of the warnings of all past time, with a full
understanding of the claims and of the controlling
agency of the great moral principles of God's
government, go on in obedience to men rather
than God, and make laws in disregard, or defiance
of his will? If so, then, from the reciprocal influence
of rulers and people, our experiment of
self-government would seem to be hopeless. Then
<i>must</i> God scourge this people as he has scourged
others. Then are the untoward symptoms of the
present time, but as the white spot that shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
leprosy. Then will the altar of liberty decay, and
the fire upon it will go out, and there will be heard
by those who watch in her temple, as of old in the
desecrated temple of God, the voice of its presiding
spirit saying, "Let us go hence," and that
temple, towards which the eyes of the nations were
turned with hope, shall become the haunt of every
unclean thing, and shall only wait the hand of
violence to leave not one stone upon another that
shall not be thrown down. In view of such consequences,
I cannot but feel that the solemn words
of our Saviour are as applicable to Legislators
and rulers in their public, as in their private capacity.
"And I say unto you, my friends, be not
afraid of them that kill the body, and after that
have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn
you whom ye shall fear: Fear him which
after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell,
yea I say unto you, Fear him."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>To His Excellency the Governor, these sentiments
are addressed, as putting him in remembrance,
as he stands upon the threshold of a new
official year, of that which ought ever to be uppermost
in the mind of the Chief Magistrate of a
Christian people, of the paramount authority of
God, and of the necessity there is that all human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
legislation should coincide with the principles of
his government. It is a great and a sacred trust
which the people of this Commonwealth commit
to their Chief Magistrate, and they expect it will
be used in the fear of God, and for the good of
this whole people. That trust is in tried hands,
and we rejoice in the belief that it is safely deposited.
Especially, may I be permitted to say,
does it give me pleasure to welcome to the chair
of state one in whose civic wreath literary honors
are entwined, and who can forget the toils and lay
aside the dignities of office, to cheer the young
scholar on his way. Long may our literary institutions
continue to raise up those who shall add
to the dignity of office, the grace of learning, and
the sanctity of private virtue; and who, while
they devote their labors more particularly to the
good of their own State, shall be regarded as belonging
to the Union and to the world.</p>

<p>To His Honor the Lieutenant Governor, to the
Honorable Council and Senate, and to the assembled
Representatives of the people, the sentiments
of this discourse are addressed, as the descendants
of those who showed in the hour of peril,
that they feared God rather than men. Following
their example, you have come up, as you are about
to enter upon your responsible duties, to present,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
in this venerable house, thanksgivings and supplications
to the Lord God of our fathers; and to do
homage in the name of the Republic, to His
Institutions. This is well. But that Republic
expects of you that you will imitate, not merely
in form, but also in spirit, the bright examples
that are set before you, that you will act from
principle, that you will "obey God rather than
men." So doing the Commonwealth will be safe,
for it is the simple wisdom of goodness, that
alone is truly wise.</p>
